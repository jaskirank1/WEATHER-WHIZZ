# WEATHER WHIZZ

Weather Whiz is a dynamic and user-friendly weather application built using React. This project leverages the power of APIs to provide real-time weather information, ensuring users are always informed about current weather conditions. Here's an overview of its key features and functionalities:

## Key Features:
1) Real-time Weather Updates:

On opening the website, users are greeted with the current weather details of their location. This includes temperature, weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.), humidity, wind speed, and other relevant metrics. The application automatically detects the user's location using their browser's geolocation services.

2) Time and Date Display:

The website prominently displays the current date and time, providing users with a comprehensive overview of their environment.

3) City Search Functionality:
Users can search for weather details of any city worldwide. By entering the city name, the application dynamically fetches and displays the relevant weather data.
This feature makes it convenient for users to check weather conditions for travel planning, checking on family and friends, or simply exploring different parts of the world.

4) API Integration:
The application utilizes the WeatherAPI service to fetch weather data. This reliable and accurate source ensures users receive the latest weather updates.
The data fetched includes a wide array of weather-related information, making the application robust and comprehensive.

5) Context API for State Management:
The React Context API is employed for state management, ensuring smooth data flow and accessibility across different components of the application.
This method enhances the scalability and maintainability of the code, making it easier to manage the application's state.

## Technical Stack:
1) Frontend: React
2) State Management: React Context API
3) API: https://www.weatherapi.com/ (for fetching weather data)
4) Geolocation Services: Browser Geolocation API for current location
5) Styling: CSS, with potential use of libraries like Bootstrap or Material-UI for enhanced design and responsiveness

## Implementation Details:
Location Detection: On loading, the application uses the browser's geolocation API to get the user's coordinates, which are then used to fetch weather data from the WeatherAPI.

API Calls: API calls are made using asynchronous functions (fetch method) to retrieve data from WeatherAPI based on the user's location or the city searched.

Context API Usage: The Context API is set up to manage the state of the application, including the user's current location, weather data, search queries, and any other global state needed for the application.

Dynamic Updates: Upon a successful city search, the application dynamically updates the weather details on the UI without requiring a page reload, providing a seamless user experience.

By combining these elements, Weather Whiz offers a robust and engaging platform for users to stay updated on weather conditions, whether at their current location or any city they wish to explore.
